        "Maximum Difference Scaling (MaxDiff) is a survey method that helps you understand people's preferences within a given set of items. Instead of asking survey respondents to rank a long list of items, MaxDiff presents small sets of options and asks people to choose only the **most and least preferred** in each set. This approach yields more reliable preference data and can be easier for participants to complete."

        """
This should get clearer throughout the tutorial, but here's a heads-up:

In a MaxDiff survey, participants see a series of questions where each presents 4-5 items from the total set of items to be prioritized. For each question:

1. Participants select the item they find **most** important or preferrable
2. They then select the item they find **least** important or preferrable

Each question includes a different combinations of items. You can then calculate relative preference scores for all items. 

For example, if studying 20 phone features, a single question might show 4 of them:

* Camera quality
* Battery life
* Screen size
* Storage capacity

The participant picks their most and least important features from this set."""
